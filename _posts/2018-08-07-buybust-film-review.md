  Among the recent batch of Philippine movies about the Southeast Asian
  country's so-called war on drugs, BuyBust is a rare beast: It actually invites
  the viewer to root for cops who shoot, stab, pummel and behead people in a
  poverty-stricken shantytown. But director Erik Matti is no cheerleader for
  populist president Rodrigo Duterte and his advocacy of extrajudicial violence.
