NOTED young Filipino pianist Clement Acevedo comes home after finishing his piano studies in the United States to open the CCP Special Concert Series on Wednesday, July 25, 2018 at 7:30 PM at the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino. Acevedo will also give a piano masterclass at the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino on July 26, 2018 at 1:00 PM.

Pianist with "a biting rhythmic drive," Acevedo has performed in China, the Philippines, and the United States. He was First Prize Winner of the 2004 National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA), Piano Category C, and semi-finalist of the 2009 Heida Hermanns International Piano Competition. He has appeared as a soloist of the Metro Manila Concert Orchestra, UST Symphony Orchestra, and James Madison University Symphony Orchestra. An enthusiastic chamber musician, he has been invited to perform in professional music festivals in the Philippines and abroad.

Acevedo earned degrees from the University of the Philippines, Temple University, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, and James Madison University where he taught as a graduate teaching assistant/fellow. His academic career has allowed him the opportunity to be a performer, scholar, educator, and administrator. An avid administrator and artistic visionary, he serves as the president-elect of Harrisonburg Music Teachers' Association, a 40-member group which organizes monthly events which invites artists and clinicians throughout the academic year.

In June 2018 he joins the music faculty of University of San Agustin Conservatory of Music in Iloilo City.

Acevedo's July 25 program cuts across different culture and styles: Filipino, American, Russian, German, French and Polish. These are American composer Chester Bicardi's Incitation to Desire, Filipino composer Robin Estrada's Pagsasanay 1 (world premiere), Russian composer Nicolai Medner's Fairytales and other works; French composer Maurice Ravel's La valse, German composer's Johannes Brahms' Klavierst√ºcke, Op. 119 and Polish composer Frederic Chopin's Sonata No. 3 in B minor, Op. 58\.
