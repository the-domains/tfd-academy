CHILDREN of all ages are invited to the celebration of the 35th National Children's Book Day (NCBD) on July 17, 2018 (Tuesday) at the Main Theater Lobby of the Cultural Center of the Philippines from 9:00am to 5:00pm with the theme Sa Aklat May Laya.  

Held every 3rd Tuesday of July, the NCBD highlights the best works of children's book writers, illustrators, and publishers, and celebrates the importance of nurturing the young readers' curiosity and imagination. 

The event's morning program consists of the awarding ceremonies for the 2018 PBBY (Philippine Board on Books for Young People)-Salanga Prize, 2018 PBBY-Alcala Prize, 2018 PBBY Wordless Book Prize, and the 2018 National Children's Book Awards. 

Towards the end of the morning, the PBBY Sa Aklat, May Laya Exhibit will be launched as well, featuring artworks related to the PBBY-Alcala Prize. This is derived from the children's stories that won the PBBY-Salanga Prize, Becky Bravo's work entitled "May Alaga Akong Bakulaw." The exhibit is free and open from July 17 to 22, 2018 at the CCP Little Theater Lobby.

At 1:30 pm, My CCP Tour activity will commence at Little Theater Lobby led by the CCP Arts Education Department.
