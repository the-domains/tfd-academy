Yoshiko marvels that nobody cries, and she witnesses her family's adverse behavior like never before. The film, which stars Yukino Kishii, Ryo Iwamatsu, Ken Mitsuishi, Jun Miho, and Miki Mizuno, won the NETPAC Award at the Black Nights Film Festival held in Estonia in 2017\.

Life seems completely unbearable, and the defenseless old woman, living in a separate room, becomes a scapegoat. It won NETPAC Award -"Pacific Meridian" at the Vladivostok International Film Festival in 2017\.

"Of Love and Law" is in partnership with Eiga Sai, the Japanese film festival, through the Japan Foundation Manila and the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines. Meanwhile, the screening of "Bad Genius" is made possible through the partnership with the Embassy of Thailand.
