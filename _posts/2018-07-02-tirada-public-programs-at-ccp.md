THE Cultural Center of the Philippines and the Association of Pinoyprintmakers will conduct upcoming public programs in line with the Tirada exhibition. The roundtable discussions, which involve the intricacies and technologies in the production of fine art prints, are open to the public.

At 4-6pm, Printmaking as a distinct form will take place with artists Joey Cobcobo, Hershey Malinis, and Jun-Jun Sta. Ana, moderated by Angelo Magno.

Come July 7 (Saturday, 2-4pm), Printmaking's potency and potential will be discussed together with visual artists Ambie Aba√±o, Jose Santos Ardivilla, and Imelda Cajipe-Endaya. The event will be moderated by Patrick D. Flores.
